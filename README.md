# Hypothesis testing: Comprehensive Analysis in Base Pay Gap Based on Gender

By Rouf Helmi, Howard Sun, Yashita Salwan, and Xiaolei Lin.

## Introduction

The gender pay gap, a term denoting the disparity in earnings between men and women, has captured the public's attention for decades (Blau & Kahn, 2007). Over time, the pressing question arises: what is the current state of this issue? To address this, we turn our focus to the "Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap" dataset, obtained in 2020 from GlassdoorÂ®, a platform known for its provision of anonymous company reviews. This dataset provides a distinctive perspective through which to examine the variability in salary among individuals with a sample size of 1000, including variables such as Job Title, Gender, Age, Performance Evaluations, Education Level, Department, and Seniority.

While some argue that factors such as education level and seniority could influence one's income, previous research has shown that they only partially account for the existing disparities (Naff, 1994). In our study, we perform a comprehensive analysis concentrating specifically on how the mean base pay differs between males and females. We aim to investigate whether a gender pay gap exists in the population, which is all professionals active in the job market.
